I decided to get on Adobe Illustrator and see if I can make some art. My main goal with Adobe Illustrator at the moment is to learn how to use the software in order to create some art. I want to see how Learnable or how easy it is to use adobe illustrator is. When I start with Adobe Illustrator, I start with nothing.

Immediately I notice how similar this layout is to Adobe Photoshop. The layout is very memorable. Memorable means it is likely to be remembered and I really like the dark theme and minimalist design. So I’m thinking that my experience with photoshop will help me learn how to use Adobe  Illustrator. Next, I look at the left side of the screen to see if the symbols on the left are like how they are in photoshop.

And my expectation that the symbols on the left represents tools are proven correct when I look at a random symbol. Looking at the rest I noticed some familiar tools from photoshop.

There are a few others that seem to be a staple to the adobe programs. These are like text and the selection tool.

Now that I see some basics of Illustrator, I tried to get started on making some art. I started using the rectangle tool to make something like an artboard to draw on.

That did nothing. Next, I looked through the tools on the left to see if there was something to help. I found a tool that says it will let me create and manage artboards. So my expectation was that I would use it to make an artboard.

I clicked it and tried using it and nothing happened. It wouldn’t work. At this point, I was unsure how to precede correctly in using the site so I thought when in doubt, go look at the top menu of the program.

I went here and clicked file to see what options showed up.

From this list of options, I clicked “New” and this showed up.

I thought I was looking at a way to create a new artboard. Wasn’t sure what all the options were on the right besides editing the artboard's dimensions so I ignored it and just clicked create. This showed up.
